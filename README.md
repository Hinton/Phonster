# Phonster

Project for the course MAMN01 - [Advanced Interaction Design](http://www.eat.lth.se/kurser/interaktionsdesign/avancerad-interaktionsdesign-mamn01/)

Phonster is an Android game which uses the Accelerometer, Compass and GPS for playing.
The course goal was to explore interactions beyond the screen.
